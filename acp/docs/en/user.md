### Create new Accounts/User

There are two ways in which user accounts can be created. Users can register themselves through the frontend (if this feature is enabled in the settings) or the user account can be created on the backend.

Users who register themselves on the frontend, must confirm their account information. They must click on the verification link which is automatically sent to their email address.

* __User is Administrator__<br>This option gives the user access to the backend.
