# Official TinyMCE jQuery integration

## About

This package is a thin wrapper around [TinyMCE](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce)
to make it easier to use in jQuery.

The jQuery integration used to be included with the default TinyMCE bundle,
starting with TinyMCE 6 it has been removed from the TinyMCE bundle and will
instead be distributed as an independent npm package.
