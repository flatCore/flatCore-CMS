<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>

<p>It is easy to <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/general-configuration-guide/customize-ui/">configure the UI</a> of your rich text editor to match the design of your site, product or application. Due to its flexibility, you can <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/general-configuration-guide/basic-setup/">configure the editor</a> with as much or as little functionality as you like, depending on your requirements.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/apps/">50+ powerful plugins available</a>, and content editable as the basis of TinyMCE, adding additional functionality is as simple as including a single line of code.</p>

<p>Realizing the full power of most plugins requires only a few lines more.</p>

<h3 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h3>

<p>Sometimes your editor requirements can be quite unique, and you need the freedom and flexibility to innovate. Thanks to TinyMCE being open source, you can view the source code and develop your own extensions for custom functionality to meet your own requirements.</p>

<p>The TinyMCE <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/api/">API</a> is exposed to make it easier for you to write custom functionality that fits within the existing framework of TinyMCE <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/ui-components/">UI components</a>.</p>
